# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ken Mbesa, a WordPress user who's rapidly learning how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

These [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges are really helping me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

# The challenge

The challenge was to build out the landing page shown above and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I had the option to use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.

to complete the challenge successfully, i need to make sure users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

# Building the project
1. I started the project by adding HTML markup to the HTML template provided to add structure to it. At this tage, I had not created a GitHub repo for the project as I just wanted to first get the ball rolling.
2. With the HTML markup now intact, I added styling for mobile screens by installing and using VS Code's Live SaSS extension by Ritwicky. For this and almost all other projects I've been working on, I've used a mobile-first workflow.
3. With a mobile version of the landing page ready, I then Initialize my project as a public repository here on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I shall now keep adding any more markup and styling to the project while it's on GitHub.
4. Am now working on the desktop and tablet versions of the landing page. I'm using media queries to make sure the page looks outstanding on those other device sizes as well.
