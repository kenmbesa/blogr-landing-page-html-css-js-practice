# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ken Mbesa, a Web and UI/UX designer who's rapidly learning how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

These [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges are really helping me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.


# The challenge

The challenge is to build out the landing page shown in the screenshot above and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

To complete the challenge successfully, I have to ensure users are able to:

- View an optimal layout of the landing page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the landing page


# Building the project
1. I started the project by adding structure and semantics to the HTML template provided. At this tage, I had not created a GitHub repo for the project as I just wanted to first get the ball rolling.
2. With the HTML markup now intact, I added styling for mobile screens by installing and using VS Code's Live SaSS extension by Ritwicky. For this and almost all other projects I've been working on, I've used a mobile-first workflow.
3. With a mobile version of the landing page ready at this point, I  Initialize my project as a public repository here on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I shall now keep adding any more markup and styling to the project while it's on GitHub.
4. Am now working on the desktop and tablet versions of the landing page. I'm using media queries to make sure the page looks outstanding on those other device sizes as well.
